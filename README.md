# Maven-Northwind-Challenge---KPI-Dashboard-for-Northwind-Traders
KPI Dashboard for Northwind Traders. Visualize sales, product performance, customers, and shipping costs. Drive informed decisions.


# Project Description

This project documents my participation in the Maven Northwind Challenge by Maven Analytics as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders. The challenge involved creating a top-level KPI dashboard to address the company's business needs and provide the executive team with valuable insights for informed decision-making.

The primary goal of the project was to develop a comprehensive overview of the company's performance in key areas, including sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs. By employing data analysis, visualization, and trend identification techniques, I extracted meaningful insights to drive strategic decision-making.

The KPI dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, allowing the executive team to quickly understand the company's performance. It was also built with scalability in mind, enabling seamless integration of new data and accommodating future growth.

# Key Features

-  Tracking of sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs.
